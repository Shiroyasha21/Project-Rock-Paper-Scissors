# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project would utilize all the things learned throughout the Fundamentals course of TheOdinProject.
This time it will make use of JavaScript to write a game program of Rock Paper Scissors.


-update

When Elden Ring came out, I used all of my free time on playing the game. I love fromsoft games and made the necessary sacrifice to enjoy the game. So it took me another month to get back to the project and complete the work with UI. 

The Rock Paper Scissor game now has the looks and a clean code although it took me days to understand functions and DOM manipulation since it's been a while since I code.
